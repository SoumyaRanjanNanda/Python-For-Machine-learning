# 🐍 Python – Introduction & History

##  Introduction to Python

* **Python** is a high-level, interpreted+compiled=Hybrid, general-purpose programming language.
* Created with simplicity and readability in mind, Python emphasizes **code readability** with significant use of **indentation**.

##  Is Anything Special in Python Language

* It supports **multiple programming paradigms**:

  * Procedural
  * Object-Oriented
  * Functional
* **Its a scripting language** (A scripting language is a programming language used to write scripts—small programs that automate tasks, control other software, or add functionality—usually interpreted rather than fully compiled.)
*  **Dynamically data type** ( A **dynamically typed data type** refers to a type system in which a variable’s data type is **determined automatically at runtime** rather than being explicitly declared by the programmer. This allows variables to **hold values of different types at different times**, providing flexibility but requiring careful handling to avoid type-related errors.

**Example (Python):**

```python
x = 42       # x is an integer
x = "Hello"  # now x is a string
```

**Key Point:** Type checking happens **at runtime**, not at compile time.

* Python is widely use General purpose language because it is hybrid You can develop 

  * Web App 🌐
  * Data Science 📊
  * Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning 🤖
  * Automation & Scripting ⚙️
  * Game Development 🎮
  * Cybersecurity 🔐
  * Desktop App
    
* Python is data-centric

Python is designed to focus on data handling and manipulation, making it easy to work with various types of data—numbers, text, lists, files, databases, or even complex structures like JSON—without worrying much about low-level details like memory management.

💡 In simple terms: Python’s features and libraries are built around storing, processing, and analyzing data efficiently, which is why it’s widely used in data science, machine learning, and automation.

### ✨ Key Features of Python

* **Easy to Learn** – Beginner-friendly syntax similar to English.
* **Interpreted** – No need for compilation, executed line by line.
* **Cross-platform** – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
* **Extensive Libraries** – NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Flask, Django, etc.
* **Open Source** – Free to use and modify.
* **Large Community Support** – Millions of developers worldwide.

## 📖 History of Python

* **1980s**: Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, worked at **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)** in the Netherlands.
* **1989 (Christmas Holidays)**: Guido began developing Python as a hobby project.
* **1991**: First official release **Python 0.9.0** was launched.

  * Included functions, exception handling, and core data types (str, list, dict, etc.).

### 📜 Major Versions of Python

* **Python 1.0 (1994)** – Introduced modules, exceptions, functions.
* **Python 2.0 (2000)** – Added list comprehensions, garbage collection, Unicode support.

  * Last update: Python 2.7 (2010).
  * Officially discontinued in **2020**.
* **Python 3.0 (2008)** – Major upgrade, not backward-compatible.

  * Improved Unicode support, print as a function, better integer division.
  * Current stable version (as of 2025): **Python 3.13**.

### 🏆 Why the name “Python”?

* Guido van Rossum named it after the **British comedy show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”**, not the snake 🐍.
* He wanted the name to be **short, unique, and fun**.

## ⚡ First Python Program

```python
# Simple Python Program
print("Hello, World! 👋")
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World! 👋
```

## ✅ Summary

* Python is a **powerful, versatile, beginner-friendly** programming language.
* Developed by **Guido van Rossum** in 1989, first released in 1991.
* Has evolved through major versions (1.x, 2.x, 3.x).
* Today, Python powers **AI, Web, Data Science, Automation**, and much more.
